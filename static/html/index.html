<h1>
 First Flask test website!!!
</h1>
<p>
  Our JavaScript file is called getData. There are two functions defined there. 
  
  By clicking the button below which says <em>Add Title</em>you, you will execute  
  a JavaScript function called addTitle(). 
<p>

<p>
Try this magical button now: 
<button onclick="addTitle()">Add Title</button>
</p>

<p>

Ok, this is a bit of a "hello, world" setup. Next up is to actually get data from our API and list those restaurants. 
You should already be able to navigate to a new URI in the browser and see something that looks like a list or an array. 
If you haven't already, go to <a href="/api/restaurants/all">/api/restaurants/all</a> in your browser. 
It should display the data from app.py, in a machine-readable format. This format is called JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation. 

</p>

<p>
Next, we want to actually get and display our restaurants data. There is a JavaScript function called getAllRestaurantNames() which does exactly this. 
</p>

<p>
Now, try this magical button:
<button onclick="getAllRestaurantNames()">Get Restaurant Names</button>
</p>
